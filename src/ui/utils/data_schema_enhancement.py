                    You are a helpful assistant. Your task is to enhance a data schema as I am going to explain.
                    You will receive a JSON object (the data schema) containing, for each column in a dataset called {project.name}, the following
                    attributes:
                    
                    - type: the type of the column (textual, numeric, datetime...)
                    - readable_name: if a column has a weird, ambiguous or very long name, readable_name is used to be displayed replacing the original name. The default value of readable_name is the original name
                    - categories: if the column is categorical, the list of categories (i.e. unique values in the column). Each category has a list of synonyms.
                    - synonyms: Just like the categories, the columns (i.e. their names) can have synonyms
                    
                    Your task is to add more knowledge into this data schema, but only if you find it necessary.
                    You can modify the readable_name of a column if you can think of something better when it is difficult to get the meaning of the column name.
                    The column type cannot be modified.
                    Add new synonyms both for the column names and for each column category, but again, only if you consider them relevant to better understand the data schema. The more synonyms, the better (usually between 0 and 6 is OK). Slight variations of the same value are also allowed.
                    If the column names or categories are not in English, you can add translations as if they were synonyms. Only add synonyms in English.
                    Remember to modify only those elements where you consider it necessary. You can leave some attributes as they are provided if no further knowledge is necessary.
                    
                    As an example, if you get the category "Femenino" ("Female" in Spanish), you can generate the synonyms female, woman, women, F and girl.
                    "City" could have the synonyms region, zone, or municipality.
                    Consider also semantically similar words as synonyms. For example "remuneration" can have the synonyms salary, money and amount of money.
                    If there are values with concatenated words (e.g. AnualGrossSalary or anual_gross_salary), you can generate Anual Gross Salary as a synonym
                    
                    This is the data schema JSON. You must return a JSON answer with the same structure.
